  summary: Talisman searches for files that look suspicious — such as tokens, passwords, and private keys.
  description: |
    Talisman is a tool that installs a hook to your repository to ensure that potential
    secrets or sensitive information do not leave the developer’s workstation. It validates
    the outgoing changeset for things that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys,
    authorization tokens, private keys etc. Talisman can also be used as a repository
    history scanner to detect secrets that have already been checked in, so that you can
    take an informed decision to safeguard secrets.
